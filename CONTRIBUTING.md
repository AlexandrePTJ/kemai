### kinds of contributions

Kemai is an open source project, and we love to receive contributions from our community. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Kemai itself.

## Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Linux. [Actions](https://github.com/AlexandrePTJ/kemai/actions) should help. 
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Making Changes

Changes are welcome via GitHub pull requests. If you are new to the project and looking for a way to get involved, try picking up an issue with a "good first issue" label. Hints about what needs to be done are usually provided.

For all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:

* Each pull request should implement ONE feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
* Always start a new feature from `develop` branch.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (eg: `.gitignore`).
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the size of the pull request.
* If your pull request is merged, please do not ask for an immediate release.
* Code formatting debates can be endless. Please ensure to use `clang-format` with root `.clang-format` file before any pull request.  
* Coding style must be as consistent as possible. Good full classes are `KimaiCache` and `KemaiSession`.
